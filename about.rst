Haskell India Group is a telegram-only, India-focused group for all using, or wanting to use the functional programming language - Haskell. Students, professionals, hobbyists, entrepreneurs & companies - all are welcome! 

The group was created on **17.May.2018**, and announced publicly exactly a day later:

This blog site serves to complement the telegram channel, with information on what we do, some articles of usefulness in general for the Haskell community.

The group also plans to run some opensource projects in github. Please feel to `head there`_ for checking out on that (this blog is also hosted there).
