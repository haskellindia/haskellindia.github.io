The ***smartest*** way to contact us is by joining the [Haskell India Group][1] on telegram. If you have any inhibitions, contact the admins of this group: [\@arvindd][4] at Coimbatore, [\@SanchayanMaity][5] at Bangalore, and [\@ajnsit][6] at Delhi - and we will be most happy to help you integrate in the group.

We are also present on a [github organisation of the same name][2]. Of course, since we are on github, a few of the developers are also on [Gitter][3].

Since the telegram group is most active, we recommend that you [start from there][1].
